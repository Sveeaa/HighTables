Line Charts
-----------

Render a line chart by adding the `render-to-line-chart` class to an existing `<table>` element or
creating a `<div>` element with the `line-chart` class. By default, the first column will be used to
label the X-axis of the chart, and each column after that will be represented as a data series.

For a [spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_%28mathematics%29), or smoothed line, use the
`render-to-spline-chart` (for a `<table>`) or `spline-chart` class (for a `<div>`).
