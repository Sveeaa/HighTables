Line Charts
-----------

Render a line chart by adding the `render-to-line-chart` class to an existing `<table>` element or
creating a `<div>` element with the `line-chart` class. By default, the first column will be used to
label the X-axis of the chart, and each column after that will be represented as a data series.
