Pie Charts
----------

You can also render pie charts by adding the `render-to-pie-chart` class to an existing `<table>`
element or creating a `<div>` with the `pie-chart` class. By default, the first column of the table
will be used to name the slices of the pie, and the values in the last column will be used to
determine the width of each slice.
