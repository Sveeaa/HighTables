Area Charts
-----------

To make an area chart instead of a line chart, add the `render-to-area-chart` class to a `<table>`
element, or create a `<div>` with the class `area-chart`.

Useful to know is that you can also easily render multiple charts from a single table. For example,
adding the `render-to-stack-chart` class to a `<table>` element (or creating another `<div>` with
the `stack-chart` class) will produce an area chart with stacked areas.
