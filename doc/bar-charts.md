Bar & Column Charts
-------------------

Add the class `render-to-bar-chart` to an existing `<table>` element or create a `<div>` with the
`bar-chart` class to create a bar chart. By default, the first column of the table will be used for
bar labels, and each remaining column will be rendered as a group of bars.

The `render-to-column-chart` (for a `<table>`) and `column-chart` classes (for a `<div>`) produce a
bar chart with vertical bars, a.k.a. a column chart.
