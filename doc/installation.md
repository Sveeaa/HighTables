Installation
------------

To use HighTables on your website, simply include [hightables.min.js](https://raw.github.com/dtao/HighTables/master/dist/hightables.min.js) (or [hightables.js](https://raw.github.com/dtao/HighTables/master/dist/hightables.js)) *after* including jQuery and Highcharts:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="highcharts.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="hightables.min.js"></script>
```

<small>Note: do *not* use the URLs of the above links as the `src` of your `<script>` tag. Unless I'm mistaken, GitHub does not want to be used as a CDN. Just serve the file from your own server.</small>
